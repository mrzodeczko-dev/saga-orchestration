## Overview
[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

Booking Service is the **Saga Orchestrator** for trip bookings in the saga-orchestration platform. It coordinates a distributed transaction across three participant services — **Flight**, **Hotel**, and **Payment** — using the orchestration-based saga pattern. The orchestrator drives the forward flow (FLIGHT -> HOTEL -> PAYMENT) and, on any failure, triggers compensating actions in reverse order. Commands are published through a transactional outbox table to guarantee exactly-once delivery to RabbitMQ, and replies are consumed from a dedicated reply queue. Built with Hexagonal Architecture, the domain model is fully decoupled from messaging and persistence infrastructure.

## How It Works
[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

### Forward Flow (Happy Path)

1. Client calls `POST /bookings` with `customerName`, `destination`, and `amount`
2. `BookingController` delegates to `StartTripBookingUseCase` (via the `TransactionalSagaOrchestrator` decorator)
3. `SagaInstance.start()` creates a new saga with three steps in PENDING status: **FLIGHT**, **HOTEL**, **PAYMENT**
4. The saga is persisted to MySQL and the first command (`FLIGHT RESERVE`) is written to the **outbox table** within the same database transaction — guaranteeing atomicity between state change and command publication
5. `OutboxEventPublisher` (ShedLock-coordinated poller, 1 s interval) picks up unpublished outbox events and sends them to RabbitMQ via `x.saga.commands` exchange with routing key `flight.command`
6. When the Flight Service replies with `SUCCESS` on `q.booking-service.replies`, `SagaReplyListener` delegates to `HandleSagaReplyUseCase`
7. The orchestrator marks the FLIGHT step as RESERVED and enqueues the next command (`HOTEL RESERVE`) via the outbox
8. Steps 6-7 repeat for HOTEL and PAYMENT
9. After the last step (PAYMENT) is RESERVED, the saga is marked **COMPLETED**

### Compensation Flow (Failure)

10. If any participant replies with `FAILURE` (e.g., HOTEL fails), the orchestrator marks that step as FAILED with the failure reason and transitions the saga to **COMPENSATING**
11. The orchestrator finds the last RESERVED step (in reverse order) and sends a `CANCEL` command
12. On `SUCCESS` reply to a CANCEL, the step is marked COMPENSATED, and the next step to compensate (going backwards) receives a CANCEL command
13. When all reserved steps are compensated, the saga is marked **CANCELLED**
14. If a compensation step itself fails, the saga transitions to **COMPENSATION_FAILED** — manual intervention required

### Idempotency & Late Replies

- If a `RESERVE SUCCESS` reply arrives for a step that is already RESERVED, the duplicate is silently ignored
- If a `CANCEL SUCCESS` reply arrives for a step that is already COMPENSATED, the duplicate is silently ignored
- Replies arriving for sagas in a terminal state (COMPLETED, CANCELLED, COMPENSATION_FAILED) are logged and discarded

### Transactional Outbox Pattern

Commands are never published directly to RabbitMQ from the saga orchestrator. Instead, `OutboxSagaCommandPublisher` calls `OutboxEventService` (which uses `Propagation.MANDATORY` — it must run within an existing transaction) to insert a row into the `outbox_events` table. The `OutboxEventPublisher` poller, protected by ShedLock to prevent duplicate processing in clustered deployments, reads unpublished events, sends them to RabbitMQ (with publisher confirms), and marks them as published. This guarantees that a saga state change and its corresponding command are committed atomically.

## Common Issues
[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

1. **MySQL connection refused** -- verify `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` matches the MySQL container host and port on the Docker network. HikariCP connection timeout is 2 000 ms. Check with `docker compose logs booking-mysql`.

2. **RabbitMQ not reachable** -- the service requires RabbitMQ to be running and accessible at `SPRING_RABBITMQ_ADDRESSES`. Verify the virtual host exists and the credentials have permissions. Inspect with `docker compose logs rabbitmq`.

3. **Outbox events not being published** -- `OutboxEventPublisher` polls every 1 000 ms and is guarded by ShedLock (`booking_outbox_publisher`, lock at most 30 s). Ensure ShedLock's database table (`shedlock`) was created by Liquibase migrations (`db/changelog/changes/004-create-shedlock-table.yaml`). If running multiple instances, verify that only one holds the lock at a time.

4. **Saga stuck in IN_PROGRESS** -- a participant service may not have sent a reply. Check the participant service logs, verify RabbitMQ queues (`q.booking-service.replies` should have no stuck messages), and inspect the DLQ (`q.booking-service.replies.dlq`) for rejected messages.

5. **Duplicate saga commands** -- the outbox pattern guarantees at-least-once delivery. Participant services must be idempotent. If the poller crashes after publishing but before marking the event as published, the same command will be resent on the next poll cycle.

6. **Reply listener errors / messages in DLQ** -- the consumer retries up to 5 times with 2 s initial interval (x2 multiplier). After exhausting retries, messages are dead-lettered to `q.booking-service.replies.dlq` via `x.saga.dlx`. Rejected messages are not requeued (`default-requeue-rejected: false`).

**Technical Highlights:**

- **Hexagonal Architecture:** Domain and application layers are fully decoupled from infrastructure. `SagaCommandPort` and `SagaInstanceRepository` define output contracts; `StartTripBookingUseCase`, `HandleSagaReplyUseCase`, and `GetSagaUseCase` define input contracts. Adapters implement them without leaking infrastructure details into business logic.
- **Transactional Outbox Pattern:** `OutboxSagaCommandPublisher` writes commands to an outbox table within the same database transaction as the saga state change (via `OutboxEventService` with `Propagation.MANDATORY`). `OutboxEventPublisher` polls the outbox and publishes to RabbitMQ with publisher confirms. This eliminates dual-write problems and guarantees at-least-once delivery.
- **ShedLock Coordination:** The outbox poller uses ShedLock 6.0.2 to ensure only one instance publishes events in a clustered deployment (`lockAtMostFor: 30s`, `lockAtLeastFor: 500ms`).
- **Rich Domain Model:** `SagaInstance` encapsulates all saga state transitions (`start`, `markReserved`, `complete`, `failAndStartCompensation`, `markCompensated`, `markCompensationFailed`, `cancel`) with validation. `SagaStep` enforces valid status transitions. `SagaStepName` defines the execution order via `next()`.
- **Transactional Decorators:** `TransactionalSagaOrchestrator` and `TransactionalSagaQueryService` wrap application services with `@Transactional` boundaries, keeping transaction management in the infrastructure layer and the application layer annotation-free.
- **RabbitMQ Reliability:** Publisher confirms (correlated mode), publisher returns with mandatory flag, consumer retry (5 retries, 2 s initial, x2 multiplier), prefetch of 10, dead-letter exchange for poison messages, and no requeue on reject.
- **Virtual Threads + container-aware JVM:** `spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true` with `-XX:+UseContainerSupport -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75.0 -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError`.

## Testing
[Back to Table of Contents](#toc)

The service has a comprehensive test suite covering the domain model, application services, infrastructure adapters, presentation layer, and consumer/producer contract verification. Unit tests use Mockito for isolation; integration tests use Testcontainers (MySQL, RabbitMQ) and Awaitility; contract tests use Spring Cloud Contract to verify message formats and consumer compatibility.
